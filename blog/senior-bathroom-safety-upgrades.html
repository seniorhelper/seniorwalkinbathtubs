<h1>Bathroom Safety Upgrades for Seniors</h1>
</header>

<section>
<h2>Falls Are the #1 Hazard for Seniors in Bathrooms</h2>
<p>According to multiple aging-in-place studies, bathrooms are among the highest-risk areas in any home. Slippery floors, high thresholds, and difficult shower access can increase fall risks significantly. Fortunately, there are smart, affordable modifications that can drastically improve safety and independence.</p>

<h2>Popular Safety Upgrades</h2>

<h3>Low Step-In Shower Entry</h3>
<p>Replacing traditional tubs with a low threshold or barrier-free shower can dramatically reduce fall risk. Accessible shower entries eliminate the need to step over a tub wall—one of the main causes of slips.</p>

<h3>Built-In Grab Bars</h3>
<p>Grab bars provide support during transfers and prevent falls. They should be strategically placed next to the toilet, inside a shower, and near any bathing seating area.</p>

<h3>Non-Slip Flooring</h3>
<p>Textured flooring provides critical traction and prevents slips. Non-slip vinyl or specialized shower bases are commonly used for senior safety upgrades.</p>

<h3>Handheld Shower Wand</h3>
<p>A handheld shower wand improves convenience by allowing bathing from a seated position—great for limited mobility or wheelchair transfers.</p>

<h2>Should You Consider a Walk-In Tub?</h2>
<p>Walk-in tubs provide seated hydrotherapy benefits and eliminate the need to navigate slippery standard tubs. Many homeowners combine walk-in tubs with accessible showers for complete bathing options.</p>

<li>Low step-in entry</li>
<li>Built-in grab bars</li>
<li>Anti-slip seating</li>

<h2>Cost-Effective Install Options</h2>
<p>You don’t always need a full bathroom remodel. Barrier-free shower units and many walk-in tubs are designed for retrofit installation, meaning installation may require minimal modification. Costs depend on the model, plumbing location, and installation accessibility.</p>
